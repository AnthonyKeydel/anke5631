I was unable to make a file generate any histogram or graph from the python scripts I used for ROS, so I resorted to putting the data into a text file and reading it into a separate file to generate the graph. That is what the plot[TYPE].py files are in the root folder.

I know the assignment said 'histogram' but mine were very uninteresting (flat, even data) so I did a bar graph for each instead.

Also as soon as GitHub recognises that this is an academic acount I will make this repo private.
